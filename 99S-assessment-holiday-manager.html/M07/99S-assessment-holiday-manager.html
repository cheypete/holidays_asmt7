<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Martin Luther King Day, Presidents Day, St. Patrick's Day, Easter, May Day, Independence Day for multiple cultures, International Talk Like a Pirate Day... these are just some of the many holidays out there.</p>
<p>You will be designing a text-based application to track holidays.</p>
<h2 id="high-level-requirements">High-Level Requirements</h2>
<p>The application user is a member of the marketing team.</p>
<ul>
<li>The admin needs to be able to manage holidays in an easy-to-use interface.</li>
<li>The admin already knows about <a href="assets/files/holidays.json">a starting JSON file named holidays.json</a> and appreciates that we have seeded the application with a base of holidays.</li>
<li>They want all of the holidays from <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/us/">https://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/us/</a> to also be preloaded.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Only preload holidays with concrete dates. Do not calculate holiday dates. The team expects you to include holidays from the present year, 2 years of past holidays, and 2 years of future holidays.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The holidays must be saved in JSON, following the formatting of the provided file</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sample-ui">Sample UI</h2>
<p>This is a sample UI which you can use as your base UI. While your UI may be different, make sure functionality outlined in the sample UI is accounted for in your UI.</p>

<h2 id="technical-requirements">Technical Requirements</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Do not use <code>pandas</code>. If you use <code>pandas</code> for this assessment, you will have to refactor your code.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Use the provided <a href="holiday_startercode.py" target="_self">starter code</a> which includes pseudo-code and some instructions so instructional staff can automatically test your code. You may need more functions than the provided functions in the starter code.</li>
<li>There is a starting JSON file named <a href="assets/files/holidays.json" target="_self">holidays.json</a> to give you an idea of what kind of data will be used.</li>
<li>Holidays should be represented as objects in Python.</li>
<li>The List of Holidays should be represented as an object in Python - see starter code for details.</li>
<li>The holiday class should include a way to display a holiday in the following format:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-console">Holiday Name (Date)
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><strong>Optional:</strong> Use a lambda expression for printing out holidays for a selected week.</li>
<li>Use flowcharts or pseudo code to visualize the design plan for your application based on your interpretation of the starter code.</li>
<li>Use a config.py file to store your URLs and credentials and specifically exclude the config file from GitHub. See the <a href="/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=7044&amp;type=content&amp;rcode=876441C2-EB5F-48AC-835D-4B82B30E744C-8031" target="_self">GitHub For Groups Tips and Tricks Resource</a> for a refresher.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="approach">Approach</h2>
<ul>
<li>Objects are commonly used when working with formatted data - such as JSON or XML.</li>
<li>These are questions that should be answered by demonstrating them in your code:
<ul>
<li>What is a lambda expression? <strong>(Optional)</strong></li>
<li>What are classes?</li>
<li>How do you use Beautiful Soup for web scraping?</li>
<li>How do you consume an API?</li>
<li>How do you store data in JSON?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="stretch-goals">Optional/Stretch Goals</h2>
<ul>
<li>With the holidays approaching, the marketing person may want to know what the weather looks like so they can determine what to market more. Use a weather API to show what the weather looks like for the current period. (See the notes below for details.) We recommend <a href="https://rapidapi.com/community/api/open-weather-map">Open Weather Map API</a>, but you are free to use any weather API you would like.</li>
<li>Allow searching for a single date and return all holidays for that date.</li>
<li>Add tags for holidays to find things such as food-related holidays, religious holidays, and cultural holidays. Then, allow for searching for all holidays by tag.</li>
<li>Save the file in another (additional) file format.
<ul>
<li>This would require a way for the user to specify which format to save in. JSON <strong>must</strong> be implemented. An additional file format is the stretch part.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Calculate dates for variable holidays - such as Mother's Day, Father's Day, Easter, and Election Day (<strong>Difficult stretch goal</strong>).
<ul>
<li>Some of the stretch goals will require you to change your menu and menu logic as well as add functions to the HolidayList Class.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
